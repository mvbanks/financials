## process
Log in to online grant dashboard
Run Report:
Approved Grants - by month
Payments Made - by month
Payments Due - updated based on payments & approvals up to and including current month
Using this data, we will compute
Grants approved that month ($)
Payments made that month ($)
Grants payable current fiscal year ($)
Grants payable future fiscal year ($)
YTD approvals ($) - THIS REQUIRES INFORMATION FROM ANOTHER REPORT (Run Report: YTD APPROVALS)
YTD payments ($) - THIS REQUIRES INFORMATION FROM ANOTHER REPORT (Run Report: YTD PAYMENTS)
Take CSV file and run it through the macro that consultant made for us
The reason this is done: look the same as previous database
This produces a sheet within the excel file
Data from these three reports needs to be plugged into the resulting financial reports. The financial reports are just a big excel spreadsheet
This data plugin is currently down manually. Our job is to automate this process using SCIENCE!
